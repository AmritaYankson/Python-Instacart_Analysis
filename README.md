# Python-Instacart_Analysis_Portfolio_Project

### Objective:

#### As data analysts for Instacart, an online grocery store, our mission is to conduct a thorough initial data analysis and exploration of the company's sales data. Our goal is to uncover deeper insights into sales patterns and propose strategies for more effective customer segmentation, ultimately guiding business strategies and marketing efforts.
---------------------------------------------

### Context:
Instacart has a diverse customer base, each with unique purchasing behaviors. Recognizing that a one-size-fits-all approach to marketing isn't optimal, Instacart aims to adopt a targeted marketing strategy. By analyzing customer data, we intend to identify distinct customer profiles and tailor marketing campaigns to resonate with each segment. This approach is anticipated to enhance the effectiveness of the marketing efforts and positively impact product sales.

In this repository, you'll find datasets, scripts, and notebooks detailing our exploratory data analysis (EDA). We focus on understanding customer varieties, analyzing purchasing behaviors, and identifying patterns that could inform targeted marketing strategies.

----------------------------------------------

### Key Questions:
* What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?
* Are there any particular times of the day when people spend the most money?
* Are there any simpler price range groupings that can help direct marketing efforts?
* Are there certain products that are more popular than others?
* What types of customers exist within our system, and how do their ordering behaviors differ?
  * What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty?
  * Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
  * Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
  * Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
  * What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
  * What differences can you find in the ordering habits of different customer profiles?

### Data Overview:
This project leverages a variety of open-source data sets from Instacart, complemented by a custom-created customer data set, to achieve its objectives. These data sets were carefully selected for their relevance to the key questions, each offering distinct insights and linked through shared identifiers.

#### Data Sets Used:
##### 1) Customers Data Set (provided by CareerFoundry):
Includes fabricated customer-specific information and prices, uniquely tailored for this project.

##### 2) Instacart Data Sets:
  * Data Dictionary: Details the fields within the data sets.
  * Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017: A comprehensive dataset essential for analysis, which includes the following additional data sets:
  * Departments
  * Orders
  * Orders_products_prior
  * Products

### Tools:
In this project, we utilized several Python libraries, each serving specific purposes in data analysis and visualization. Features like Pandas' data structures, Seaborn's statistical graphics, Matplotlib's plot control, and NumPy and SciPy's mathematical capabilities were invaluable in our analysis.

* Pandas: Essential for data manipulation and analysis.
* Seaborn: A powerful library for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.
* Matplotlib: A foundational library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
* NumPy: The fundamental package for scientific computing.
* SciPy: Provides more advanced utilities for optimization, regression, and other scientific computing tasks.
